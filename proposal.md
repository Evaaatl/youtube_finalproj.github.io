### The tentative project title:

Visualizing the Pulse of Global Entertainment: A Data-Driven Exploration
of YouTube Statistics

### The motivation for this project:

In this rapidly advancing AI era, social media has become multifaceted,
exemplified by YouTube’s emergence as a platform for showcasing
educational projects. Our project is focused on analyzing user-shared
content and subscription patterns on YouTube to reveal global viewing
habits and the keys to content creators’ success. This endeavor aims to
simplify the complexity of digital interactions for content creators,
advertisers, and educators, offering them clear insights into how to
engage audiences effectively on YouTube across various regions.

### The intended final products:

The project will deliver a Comprehensive Analysis Report detailing
YouTube trends and engagement, an Interactive Dashboard for tracking
real-time KPIs, Predictive Models to forecast engagement, and a Data
Visualization Suite for easy interpretation of data through various
graphical representations.

### The anticipated data sources:

<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-youtube-statistics-2023/>
The source data is derived from the Kaggle dataset ‘EDA Global YouTube
Statistics 2023,’ offering comprehensive details on top creators’
subscriber counts, rank, video views, category, upload frequency,
country of origin, earnings, and more.”

### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges：

- Trend Analysis: Tracking the rise and fall of content categories over
  time and across geographies.
- Predictive Analytics: Using historical data to predict future trends
  in viewer engagement.
- Cluster Analysis: Segmenting videos or channels to identify niche
  markets or content gaps.
- Challenges: Creating a responsive and intuitive dashboard.Integrating
  diverse data sources to provide a holistic view of YouTube’s global
  impact.

### The planned timeline:
